Andrew Ng Machine Learning by Standford University 

[Course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)
This was recommended from a friend as a good relativly quick review of machine learning. 

Each directory corresponds to chapter from the class and  will contain, a pdf of class materials,  a jupyter notebook of my notes and example problems  along with any assosiated datafiles.
